# PSSTemplates

## Synopsis

Project that contains file / project templates for Sapien's PowerShell Studio.
These can be used to speed up project development and consist of my own templates.

## How to use

1) Clone this project to your local machine
2) Open PowerShell Studio
3) Open options
4) On the main tab, change the Template directory setting to "<git project folder>\Templates"

The templates are now available when creating new files, projects or generating help

## Purpose

This project is inherently selfish in purpose: I use it to share my own templates and snippets across all my machines in a manner that provides version control.
It also allows me to share these templates with the rest of the world in the unlikely case that anybody cares.
